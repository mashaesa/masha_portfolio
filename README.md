# **About Me**  
### **Data Analyst | AI Enthusiast | Creative Problem-Solver**

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  

I’m **Masha**, a data analyst with an insatiable curiosity for uncovering the stories hidden within data. My journey began in an unexpected place—during the quiet chaos of lockdown, where I taught myself to navigate financial markets, analyse trends, and build trading strategies. What started as a survival skill quickly grew into a deep fascination with patterns, automation, and the limitless potential of data-driven solutions.

Fast forward a few years, and I’ve transformed that curiosity into a **dynamic career**. From crafting predictive models that forecast air traffic to designing a Python-powered trading bot that automates decisions in real time, I thrive on turning complex challenges into **elegant solutions**. I’m passionate about combining technical expertise with creativity to not only solve problems but to innovate in ways that make a lasting impact.

From uncovering **£2M revenue opportunities** for Olist Marketplace to analysing public health trends, I specialise in turning raw numbers into stories that drive decisions.

### **Why I Love What I Do**  
For me, every dataset feels like an **uncharted map, waiting to reveal its secrets**.  
Each project is a chance to:  
- **Unravel mysteries**,  
- **Connect the dots**, and  
- **Uncover the unexpected**.  

Whether I’m crafting dashboards that transform complexity into clarity or experimenting with machine learning to predict the future, I dive in with the **curiosity of an explorer** and the **determination to push past the ordinary**.  

**Data isn’t just numbers to me—it’s a playground for discovery, creativity, and innovation.**

### **Let’s Collaborate**  
If you’re as excited about **data, AI, and automation** as I am, let’s connect! Whether you’re tackling a big challenge or brainstorming ideas, I’d love to explore how we can make something extraordinary together.
